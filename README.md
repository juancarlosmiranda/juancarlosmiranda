Hi, I'm Juan Carlos Miranda, I worked as a developer in a software company. I was also a teacher at the Catholic
University "Nuestra Señora de Asunción" Campus Itapúa. Currently I am a PhD student at the University of Lleida in the
Research Group on Precision Agriculture (GRAP) - Department of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering. My work focuses on
the application of photonic sensors, computer vision and spatial sampling methods to estimate fruit load in apple trees.

| AK_ACQS Azure Kinect Acquisition System | AK_ACQS is a software solution for data acquisition in fruit orchards using a sensor system boarded on a terrestrial vehicle. It allows the coordination of computers and sensors through the sending of remote commands via a GUI. At the same time, it adds an abstraction layer on library stack of each sensor, facilitating its integration. This software solution is supported by a local area network (LAN), which connects computers and sensors from different manufacturers ( cameras of different technologies, GNSS receiver) for in-field fruit yield testing. https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_acquisition_system |
