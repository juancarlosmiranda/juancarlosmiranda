Hi, I'm Juan Carlos Miranda, I worked as a developer in a software company. I was also a teacher at the Catholic
University "Nuestra Señora de Asunción" Campus Itapúa. Currently I am a PhD student at the University of Lleida in the
Research Group on Precision Agriculture (GRAP) of the Department of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering. My work
focuses on the application of photonic sensors, computer vision and spatial sampling methods to estimate fruit load in
apple trees.
