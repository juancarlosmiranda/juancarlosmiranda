Hi, I'm Juan Carlos Miranda, I worked in a software company as a developer in Paraguay. I was also a teacher at the Catholic University "Nuestra Señora de Asunción" Campus Itapúa. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Lleida and I work in the Research Group on Precision Agriculture (GRAP) of the Department of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering. I use RGB-D cameras and I try to keep learning every day. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juan-Miranda-6](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juan-Miranda-6)
