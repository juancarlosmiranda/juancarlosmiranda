Hi, my name is Juan Carlos Miranda, I am currently a PhD student at the University of Lleida in the Research Group on Precision Agriculture (GRAP) - Department of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering. My work focuses on the application of photonic sensors, computer vision and spatial sampling methods to estimate fruit load in apple trees.

| Package                   | Description            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| AK_ACQS Azure Kinect Acquisition System ([https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_acquisition_system](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_acquisition_system)) | AK_ACQS is a software solution for data acquisition in fruit orchards using a sensor system boarded on a terrestrial vehicle. It allows the coordination of computers and sensors through the sending of remote commands via a GUI. At the same time, it adds an abstraction layer on library stack of each sensor, facilitating its integration. This software solution is supported by a local area network (LAN), which connects computers and sensors from different manufacturers ( cameras of different technologies, GNSS receiver) for in-field fruit yield testing. |
| AK_SM_RECORDER - Azure Kinect Standalone Mode ([https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_sm_recorder](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_sm_recorder)) | A simple GUI recorder based on Python to manage Azure Kinect camera devices in a standalone mode. ([https://pypi.org/project/ak-sm-recorder/](https://pypi.org/project/ak-sm-recorder/])) |
| AK_FRAEX - Azure Kinect Frame Extractor ([https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_frame_extractor](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_frame_extractor)) | AK_FRAEX is a desktop tool created for post-processing tasks after field acquisition. It enables the extraction of information from videos recorded in MKV format with the Azure Kinect camera. Through a GUI, the user can configure initial parameters to extract frames and automatically create the necessary metadata for a set of images. ([https://pypi.org/project/ak-frame-extractor/](https://pypi.org/project/ak-frame-extractor/))|
| AK_SIMULATOR - Azure Kinect Size Estimation & Weight Prediction Simulator ([https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_simulator/](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_simulator/)) | Python based GUI tool for fruit size estimation and weight prediction. ([https://pypi.org/project/ak-simulator/](https://pypi.org/project/ak-simulator/)) |
| AK_VIDEO_ANALYSER - Azure Kinect Video Analyser ([https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_video_analyser/](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_video_analyser/)) | Python based GUI tool for fruit size estimation and weight prediction from videos recorded with the Azure Kinect DK sensor camera in Matroska format. It receives as input a set of videos to analyse and gives as result reports in CSV datasheet format with measures and weight predictions of each detected fruit. ([https://pypi.org/project/ak-video-analyser/](https://pypi.org/project/ak-video-analyser/)). |
