Hi, I'm Juan Carlos Miranda, I worked for a software company as a developer in Paraguay. I was also a teacher at the Catholic University “Nuestra Señora de Asunción” Campus Itapúa. I am currently pursuing a Phd at the University of Lleida and work in the Precision Agriculture Research Group (GRAP) of the Department of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering. The title of my thesis is "Combining the use of photonic sensors, artificial vision and spatial sampling methods to estimate fruit load". I use RGB-D cameras and try to keep learning every day. https://github.com/juancarlosmiranda
